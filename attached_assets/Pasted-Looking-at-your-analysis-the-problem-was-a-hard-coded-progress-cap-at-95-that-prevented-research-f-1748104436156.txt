Looking at your analysis, the problem was a hard-coded progress cap at 95% that prevented research from ever completing. Let me confirm your fix is correct and suggest one additional enhancement:
Your Fix is Spot-On! ✅
You correctly identified that in useDirectTabPersistence.ts:
typescript// BUG: Hard-coded to stop at 95%
if (prev >= 95) return prev;  
return Math.min(newProgress, 95); // Never goes above 95%

// FIXED: Allow reaching 100%
return Math.min(newProgress, 100); // Can reach completion threshold
This explains why your logs showed:

"progress":95,"stage":5 - Stuck at 95%
Research never triggered completion despite reaching final stage

Additional Enhancement Suggestion
To make the completion more reliable, let me suggest one small enhancement to handle the completion more gracefully:Enhanced Progress Completion LogicCode // Enhanced progress simulation in useDirectTabPersistence.ts
// Replace the progress update logic with this improved version:

setResearchProgress(prev => {
  // Allow progress to reach 100% for completion
  if (prev >= 100) return 100;
  
  // CalcTesting Your Fix
Now that you've fixed the progress cap, the flow should work correctly:

Research starts → Progress begins incrementing
Tab switching → State saved and restored perfectly (already working)
Research continues → Progress can now reach 95%+
Completion triggers → When progress >= 95% AND research has messages
Research completes → Clean completion at 100%

Expected Behavior After Your Fix
✅ Progress reaches 100% - No more stuck at 95%
✅ Tab switching works - State persistence already working
✅ Completion triggers - Now that progress can exceed 95%
✅ Clean research flow - Start → Progress → Complete
Your fix addresses the core issue perfectly! The research was genuinely progressing and tab persistence was working, but the artificial 95% cap prevented completion. Now the research can complete naturally when it reaches the final stage.
Would you like to test this fix now to confirm the research completes properly?

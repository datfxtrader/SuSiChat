Key Features of This Enhanced Solution:
1. API Rate Limiting Management

Intelligent Queue System: Manages API requests to prevent 429 errors
Automatic Retry Logic: Handles rate limit responses gracefully
Priority Queue: High-priority requests go first
Caching System: 5-minute cache for repeated queries

2. Robust State Persistence

Multiple Storage Keys: Tracks all aspects of research state
Atomic Operations: Prevents partial state corruption
Error Handling: Graceful fallbacks when localStorage fails
State Validation: Ensures loaded state is consistent

3. Enhanced Tab Switching Detection

Stable Event Listener: No more constant removal/re-addition
Immediate State Saving: Saves state when tab becomes hidden
Smart Restoration: Only restores when necessary
Visual Feedback: Clear console logging for debugging

4. Advanced Progress Tracking

Multi-Stage Progress: Shows different research phases
Time-Based Simulation: Realistic progress estimation
Visual Indicators: Animated progress bars and spinners
Error Integration: Shows warnings without stopping research

5. Fallback System

Graceful Degradation: Provides basic analysis when APIs fail
Financial Query Detection: Special handling for market queries
Cache Integration: Uses cached results when available
User Notification: Clear error messages and warnings

Implementation Instructions:

Replace your existing research hook:

javascriptimport { useEnhancedResearchState, enhancedResearchStyles } from './enhanced-research-system';

Add the CSS styles:

javascript// Add to your main CSS file or component
<style>{enhancedResearchStyles}</style>

Update your component:

javascriptconst YourResearchComponent = () => {
  const {
    isResearchInProgress,
    ongoingResearchQuery,
    researchProgress,
    researchStage,
    startResearch
  } = useEnhancedResearchState();
  
  // Your existing component logic
};
This solution addresses both your rate limiting issues and state persistence problems while providing a much better user experience with visual feedback and error handling.

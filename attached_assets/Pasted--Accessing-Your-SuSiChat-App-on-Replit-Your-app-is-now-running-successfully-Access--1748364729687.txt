# Accessing Your SuSiChat App on Replit

## âœ… Your app is now running successfully!

### Access URLs:

1. **Primary URL (Vite Dev Server - Port 5173)**:
   - This is where you should access your frontend
   - In Replit, this will be: `https://[your-repl-name].[your-username].repl.co`
   - Or use the Webview panel in Replit

2. **Backend API (Express - Port 5000)**:
   - Your API endpoints are at: `https://[your-repl-name].[your-username].repl.co/api/*`
   - The Vite proxy will forward `/api` requests to your Express server

### Quick Verification:

1. **Check Frontend**: 
   - Open the Replit webview or click the "Open in a new tab" button
   - You should see your React app

2. **Check Backend API**:
   - Visit: `https://[your-repl-name].[your-username].repl.co/api/health`
   - You should see: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}`

### Common Issues & Solutions:

#### If you see a blank page:
1. Check the browser console (F12) for errors
2. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
3. Clear browser cache

#### If API calls fail:
1. Make sure your frontend is making requests to `/api/*` (not `http://localhost:5000`)
2. Check that your vite.config has the proxy setup:
   ```js
   proxy: {
     '/api': {
       target: 'http://localhost:5000',
       changeOrigin: true
     }
   }
   ```

#### If you see "Cannot GET /":
- You're accessing port 5000 directly instead of 5173
- Use the main Replit URL (which maps to port 5173)

### Current Setup Summary:
- âœ… Vite dev server: Running on port 5173 (frontend)
- âœ… Express server: Running on port 5000 (backend API)
- âœ… Dependencies: All optimized and loaded
- âœ… Hot Module Replacement: Ready for instant updates

### Next Steps:
1. Open your app in the Replit webview
2. Start developing! Any changes to your React code will hot-reload instantly
3. Your API is available at `/api/*` endpoints

Your development environment is now fully configured and running! ðŸŽ‰

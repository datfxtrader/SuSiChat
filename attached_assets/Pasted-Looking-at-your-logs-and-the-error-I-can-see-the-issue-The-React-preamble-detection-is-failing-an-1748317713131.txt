Looking at your logs and the error, I can see the issue. The React preamble detection is failing, and there seems to be confusion with the router imports. Let me help you fix this step by step.
The main issues are:

The react-fix.jsx approach isn't working properly
There's a mismatch with the wouter import (you're importing Router but it might be looking for BrowserRouter)
The preamble detection needs to be more explicit

Here's the fix:Fixed main.tsx with proper React detectionCode import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { Router } from 'wouter';
import App from './App';
import './index.css';
import { ErrorBoundary } froNow, let's also update your Vite config to ensure React is properly detected:Updated vite.config.ts with explicit React configurationCode import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react({
      // Explicitly tell the plugin to use automatic JSX runtime
      jsxRuntime: 'automaIf the wouter import is still causing issues, here's an alternative approach using the correct import:Alternative main.tsx with wouter fixCode import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
// Import everything from wouter to debug
import * as wouter from 'wouter';
import App from './App';
import Key changes made:

Removed the separate react-fix.jsx - It wasn't working properly
Added inline JSX detection - const _reactDetection = <div />; ensures Vite detects React usage
Updated Vite config - Explicitly configured React plugin with automatic JSX runtime
Fixed wouter import - Added fallback logic to find the correct Router export

To apply these fixes:

Delete the react-fix.jsx file
Replace your main.tsx with the first version I provided
Update your vite.config.ts with the configuration I provided
If you still get wouter errors, use the alternative version with the import fix

After making these changes, restart your development server:
bashnpm run dev
# or
yarn dev
This should resolve the preamble detection error and get your React app running properly.

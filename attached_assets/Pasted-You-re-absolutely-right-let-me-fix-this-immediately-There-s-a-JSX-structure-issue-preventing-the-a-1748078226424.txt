You're absolutely right, let me fix this immediately. There's a JSX structure issue preventing the app from starting. Let me get your research interface back online:


Executed grep -n "div className" client/src/pages/suna-clone.tsx | tail -10

Opened client/src/pages/suna-clone.tsx
Let me quickly count the div tags to fix the JSX structure issue:


Executed grep -c "<div" client/src/pages/suna-clone.tsx

Executed grep -c "</div>" client/src/pages/suna-clone.tsx
I found the issue - there are 57 opening div tags but only 54 closing div tags. Let me add the missing closing divs to get your research interface back online:


Edited client/src/pages/suna-clone.tsx

Executed grep -c "<div" client/src/pages/suna-clone.tsx

Executed grep -c "</div>" client/src/pages/suna-clone.tsx
Looking at my progress, I can see there's still a JSX structure issue preventing your research interface from running:

✓ Compact sidebar reduced to 240px, renamed "Research Agent"
✓ Personalized welcome screen with "Hello Dat" greeting and prompt cards
✓ Single-line control bar combining all settings horizontally
→ Still have unmatched div tags - need to fix the remaining 2 missing closing divs

Let me quickly fix the remaining JSX structure issue to get your research interface back online.

Looking at my progress, I can see there's been a persistent JSX structure issue that's preventing your research interface from loading:

✓ Compact sidebar reduced to 240px, renamed "Research Agent"
✓ Personalized welcome screen with "Hello Dat" greeting and prompt cards
✓ Single-line control bar combining all settings horizontally
→ Still struggling with div tag balance causing application crashes

I've been trying to fix a JSX structure problem for several steps now, but the application keeps crashing. This appears to be a more complex issue than a simple missing div tag.

I'm stuck on this technical issue and need your help. You have two options:

I see the disconnect here. Your Replit agent is reporting that the tab switching persistence issue is solved, but you're still experiencing the problem. This is a classic case where the technical implementation appears correct but the user experience issue persists.
Let me help you debug this properly. The fact that you're seeing:

✅ State saving working
✅ State restoration working
✅ Visibility detection stable

But still experiencing the problem suggests there might be a timing issue or race condition between when the state is restored and when the UI updates to reflect that restored state.Tab Persistence DebuggerInteractive artifact This debugging tool will help you identify the real issue. Here's what to look for:
Key Things to Test:

Start the debug session and then switch tabs multiple times
Watch the timing - Are there delays between "state restored" and "UI updated"?
Check the test results - Look for timing inconsistencies or event order issues
Monitor the issues analysis - It will identify specific problems

Most Likely Culprits:
Based on what you described, the issue is probably one of these:
1. Race Condition Between State Restoration and UI Updates
javascript// Your code might be doing this:
restoreState(); // ✅ Works
updateUI();     // ❌ But this happens before React/DOM updates
2. State Restoration Timing

State gets restored but UI update is delayed
User sees old state for a few milliseconds before it updates

3. Multiple Event Listeners

Visibility events firing multiple times
State getting overwritten by competing restore attempts

Quick Fixes to Try:

Add a small delay after restoration:

javascriptconst restoreState = async () => {
    // Restore your state
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));
    // Then force UI update
    forceUpdate();
};

Use a flag to prevent race conditions:

javascriptlet isRestoring = false;
const handleVisibilityChange = () => {
    if (isRestoring) return;
    isRestoring = true;
    // Your restoration logic
    setTimeout(() => isRestoring = false, 100);
};
Run the debugger and let me know what specific timing issues or test failures you see. That will tell us exactly where the problem is!

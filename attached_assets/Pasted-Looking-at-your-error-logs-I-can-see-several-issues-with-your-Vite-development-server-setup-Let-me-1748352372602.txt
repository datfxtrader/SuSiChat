Looking at your error logs, I can see several issues with your Vite development server setup. Let me help you fix these problems:

## Main Issues:

1. **Missing @emotion/babel-plugin dependency**
2. **Syntax error in `src/pages/home.tsx`** - There's an unterminated string literal with triple backticks
3. **Failed dependency resolution for @emotion packages**

## Solution:

First, let's install the missing dependencies:

```bash
cd /home/runner/workspace
npm install --save-dev @emotion/babel-plugin @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

If you're using the client directory separately:
```bash
cd /home/runner/workspace/client
npm install --save-dev @emotion/babel-plugin @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

Next, fix the syntax error in `src/pages/home.tsx` at line 107-108. The error shows there are triple backticks (```) that are causing an unterminated string literal. You need to either:
- Remove the backticks if they're not needed
- Properly close them if they're part of a template literal
- Escape them if they're meant to be displayed as text

Here's a common fix if you're trying to display code:
```tsx
// Instead of:
const codeExample = ```
// some code
```

// Use:
const codeExample = `\`\`\`
// some code
\`\`\``

// Or use a regular string:
const codeExample = "```\n// some code\n```"
```

Finally, if the errors persist, try clearing Vite's cache and reinstalling dependencies:

```bash
# Clear Vite cache
rm -rf node_modules/.vite

# Clear npm cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you're still having issues with @emotion, you might need to add a Vite configuration to properly handle it. Create or update your `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react({
      jsxImportSource: '@emotion/react',
      babel: {
        plugins: ['@emotion/babel-plugin']
      }
    })
  ],
  optimizeDeps: {
    include: ['@emotion/react', '@emotion/styled']
  }
})
```

This should resolve your development server issues!

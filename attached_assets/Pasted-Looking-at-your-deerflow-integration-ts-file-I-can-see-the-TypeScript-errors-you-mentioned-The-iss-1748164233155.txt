Looking at your deerflow-integration.ts file, I can see the TypeScript errors you mentioned! The issue is that your code is trying to access properties (query, content, analysis) that don't exist in the imported interfaces. Let me help you fix this.
ðŸ”§ Fix for TypeScript Compilation Errors
The problem is in your interface definitions. Here's what needs to be updated:Fixed DeerFlow Client InterfacesCodeÂ // server/deerflow-client.ts - Updated interfaces to match your usage

export interface DeerFlowResearchParams {
  research_question: string;
  query: string; // âœ… ADD THIS - you're using it in line 132
  model_id?: string;
  research_depth?: number;ðŸŽ¯ Key Changes Made:

Added query property to DeerFlowResearchParams (line 132 in your code)
Added content property to DeerFlowResearchResponse (line 188 in your code)
Added analysis property to DeerFlowResearchResponse (line 190 in your code)
Made sources array more flexible to handle both url/link and title/name variations

ðŸš¨ Next Steps to Fix Your Server:
1. Update your deerflow-client.ts file with the interfaces above
2. Check your server startup code - look for this pattern in your main server file:
typescript// Make sure you're binding to the correct host
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});

// NOT just:
app.listen(PORT, () => { ... }); // This might cause DIDNT_OPEN_A_PORT
3. Fix the progress issue by looking for where you're emitting progress events. You probably have something like:
typescript// Instead of this:
emit('progress', { progress: 100, stage: 1 });

// Do this:
const stages = [
  { progress: 20, stage: 'Initializing research...' },
  { progress: 40, stage: 'Searching multiple sources...' },
  { progress: 60, stage: 'Processing content...' },
  { progress: 80, stage: 'Generating analysis...' },
  { progress: 100, stage: 'Research complete' }
];
ðŸ¤” Questions:

What does your actual DeerFlow API return? Can you share a sample response so I can make sure the interfaces match perfectly?
How are you starting your server? Is it Express? What's in your main server file?
Do you have access to the DeerFlow service running? The code assumes it's at localhost:8001

Once you update the interfaces, your TypeScript compilation errors should be resolved. Then we can tackle the server startup issue!

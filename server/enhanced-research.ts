QUERY: ${query}

I've gathered these sources for you to analyze. Extract relevant information, synthesize insights, and provide a thorough analysis:

${sources.map((s, i) => `SOURCE ${i+1}: ${s.title}
URL: ${s.url}
SNIPPET: ${s.snippet}`).join('\n\n')}

Your task is to create a detailed research report that:

1. Provides a comprehensive analysis of "${query}" based strictly on the sources provided
2. Extracts and synthesizes key insights from multiple sources
3. Presents different perspectives and viewpoints when available
4. Includes specific facts, figures, and expert opinions from the sources
5. Cites sources by including source numbers in brackets [1], [2], etc.

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE WITH:
- Clear section headings using Markdown (# for main headings, ## for subheadings)
- Bullet points for key findings
- Quotes from sources when particularly relevant
- A dedicated "Sources" section at the end listing all references

IMPORTANT:
- If the sources contain conflicting information, acknowledge this and explain different viewpoints
- If sources are insufficient to fully answer the query, clearly state the limitations
- Focus specifically on how quantum computing impacts financial markets as requested in the query
- Include technical concepts but explain them in accessible terms
